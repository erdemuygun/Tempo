### Generate PRP for Tempo Metronome Application
- **Date Added**: 2025-07-14
- **Status**:  Completed
- **Description**: Created comprehensive PRP for GTK4 metronome application with Blueprint UI, GStreamer audio, and Flatpak packaging
- **Output**: `PRPs/tempo-metronome.md`

## Completed Tasks

### Generate PRP for Tempo Metronome Application (2025-07-14)
- Created detailed implementation plan following PRP template
- Researched GTK4, Libadwaita, Blueprint, and GStreamer best practices
- Included 11 implementation tasks with validation gates
- Confidence score: 9/10 for one-pass implementation

## Discovered During Work

- Blueprint UI syntax requires compilation to .ui files during build
- GStreamer timing requires separate thread with GLib.idle_add for UI updates
- Metronome timing must use absolute time references (time.perf_counter()) to avoid drift
- Flatpak audio requires explicit --socket=pulseaudio permission
- GTK4 applications should use Adw.ApplicationWindow, not Gtk.ApplicationWindow
